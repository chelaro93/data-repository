# Climate tweets, May 2017

This file contains 122,379 tweets about climate change from approximately 5/8â€“5/18, 2017. The tweets were downloaded using [`rtweet`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/index.html) and Twitter's REST API. Specifically, I searched for tweets containing "climate change" or "global warming":

    search_tweets(q = '"climate change" OR "global warming"', n = 1000000, include_rts = FALSE, retryonratelimit = TRUE)

I then deleted some extraneous variables to keep the size of this file reasonable.
